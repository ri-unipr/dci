# Relevance Index (RI)

Implementation of the RI in C++ (requires CUDA 9 or higher).

Once downloaded the whole project folder, compile the binaries.

On Linux machines:

* make dci
* make kmpso

To test dci, enter the scripts folder and run:

* python automatic_sieve.py

Python 3 is assumed to be installed.

To test kmpso, enter the scripts7 folder and run:

* ./tc-kmpso-test.sh 
* ./zi-kmpso-test.sh

The first test uses the Tc index, while the second test uses the ZI index.
